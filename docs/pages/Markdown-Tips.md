# GFG

GFM is an acronym for Git Hub Flavor'd Markdown

**Rule**. All markdown pages carry the suffix (.md)

***

## Creating Headers

>When creating headers using GitHub Flavored Markdown (.md) ...

>Simply place one `#` = `<h1>`, two `##` = `<h2>`, or three `###` = `<h3>` sharp symbols in front of the text you wish to emphasize.

***

## Emphasizing Text

>When **emphasizing** text using GitHub Flavored Markdown (.md) ...

>Simply place two (**) asterisk symbols in front of, and in back of the text you wish to **emphasize**.

***

## Liquid Link Tags

The liquid `link` tag may be pre-pended by a **Liquid Variable Statement** commonly known as a *moustache*, as follows:

### The Code A

**Note**. The following three ellipsis inside the **Liquid Variable Statement** are shown as merely placeholders.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{...}}
{% endraw %}
```

### The Code B

**Note**. Inside the pre-pending *moustache* or **Liquid Variable Statement**, the object `site` may be placed with a reference to the `site baseurl` property via dot notation, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ site.baseurl }}
{% endraw %}
```

### The Code C

**Note**. The `site baseurl` may be fixed by the user at the underscore config dot yml file, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
baseurl: "/Liquid-Lessons-Project"
{% endraw %}
```

## The Link Tag

Next, the `link` tag is built within a separate liquid statement adjacent to and appending the liquid variable statement, as follows:

### The Code D

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% link pages/Markdown-Target-Blank.md %}
{% endraw %}
```

Here, the `link` tag followed by a space points to the `pages` Subdirectory where the **GFM** file is housed.

Notice the extension, in this case `(.md)` must be included when declaring a liquid `link` tag.

Putting the two liquid statements together "live" we have the following "live" rendition complete with clickable text `[...]` pre-pending all ...

### The Code E

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Target Blank]{{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Markdown-Target-Blank.md %}
{% endraw %}
```

### Live E

[Target Blank]{{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Markdown-Target-Blank.md %}

***

## Inline Anchor Links

Inline anchor links that point internally to other pages within the repo require a separate bracketed `[page.name]` followed by a relative `/page.url` prepended by the `site.github.url` enveloped in a *moustache* or **Liquid Variable Statement** `{\{...}\}`, and enclosed in a single set of parenthesis `(...)`, as follows:

### The Code F

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Home Page]({{ site.github.url }}/index)
{% endraw %}
```

### Live F

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. Just typing along and here comes an inline anchor link! ... Click! ... [Home Page]({{ site.github.url }}/index).

**Note**. To effect an inline anchor link while served relatively at the remote GitHub-Jekyll web server farm, prepend the `/page.url` with the `site.github.url`, as follows:

### The Code G

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Target Blank]({{ site.github.url }}/pages/Target-Blank)
{% endraw %}
```

### Live G

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. Another inline anchor link ... [Target Blank]({{ site.github.url }}/pages/Target-Blank).

***

## Stand Alone External Hyperlinks

Inline hyperlinks with bracketed clickable text `[MMINAIL]` may be followed by the `site.url` simply enclosed in a single set of parenthesis `(...)` followed by a target indicator, as follows:

### The Code H

```liquid
{% raw %}
[MMINAIL](https://mminail.github.io){:target="_blank"}
{% endraw %}
```

### Live H

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. A stand alone, clickable text, external hyperlink with target blank ... [MMINAIL](https://mminail.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

***

## Auto External Hyperlinks

Stand alone "auto" URLs that point to external targets may be enclosed in angle brackets `<...>` and optionally prepended by a bracketed `[external.site.name]`, as follows:

### The Code I

```liquid
{% raw %}
[MMINAIL] <https://mminail.github.io>
{% endraw %}
```

### Live I

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. A list item hyperlink ...

- [MMINAIL] <https://mminail.github.io>

**Note**. All external "auto" URLs must start with `https`.

***

## Reference Style Hyperlinks

An external `site.url` may also be referenced by an inline bracketed clickable text `[MMINAIL]` followed by a bracketed index number `[1]`, as follows:

### The Code J

```liquid
{% raw %}
The [MMINAIL][1] link in this paragraph ...
{% endraw %}
```

### Live J

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. The [MMINAIL][1] link in this paragraph is anchored by a citation in the `nofooter` below.

The citation below is comprised of the aforementioned bracketed index number `[1]` followed by a colon `:` followed by the `site.url` of the targeted destination.

**Note**. The citation actually sits below this fifth paragraph of text, hidden in the `nofooter` of this example.

[1]:https://mminail.github.io

But, can now become manifest, as next illustrated ...

### The Code K

```liquid
{% raw %}
[1]:https://mminail.github.io
{% endraw %}
```

***

## Enabling Hyperlinks

>When enabling hyperlinks using GitHub Flavored Markdown (.md) ...

>Simply place a "bracket" symbol \[ label part ] in front of ( and, at the end of ) the label part of your hyperlink.

>Then, encircle the URL with "parenthesis", \( URL ) as follows:

## Example

### The Code L

```liquid
{% raw %}
Copyright ©2016 [The Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited](https://cannabuds.us/). All rights reserved.
{% endraw %}
```

### Live L

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. Copyright ©2016 [The Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited](https://cannabuds.us/). All rights reserved.

### The Code M

```liquid
{% raw %}
This Webpage is being hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
{% endraw %}
```

### Live M

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. This Webpage is being hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

***

## Enabling Image URLs

When enabling Image URLs using GitHub Flavored Markdown (.md) ...

Simply place a "bracket" symbol in front of ( and, at the end of ) the 'Alt text' part of your Image URL.

Then, encircle the URL with "parenthesis", as follows:

### The Code N

```liquid
{% raw %}
[8 x 4 Solar Panel Array With Dual Axis Tracking](../assets/img/Canna-Solar-32-Panel-Array-8-x-4-w-dual-axis-tracking-640-x-480-px.png)
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. Be sure to to place the 'images' subdirectory that holds the actual image file (.png) under the same subdirectory that houses your document file (.md) ie.) pages

Finally, to enable the fetching and rendering of your subject image, place an exclamation point '!' at the beginning of your image statement, as follows:

### The Code O

```liquid
{% raw %}
![8 x 4 Solar Panel Array With Dual Axis Tracking](../assets/img/Canna-Solar-32-Panel-Array-8-x-4-w-dual-axis-tracking-640-x-480-px.png)
{% endraw %}
```

***

## Stand Alone URLs

When enabling **Stand Alone URLs** using GitHub Flavored Markdown (.md) ...

Simply type the URL as a Stand Alone URL, as follows:

C=> https://medmj.us/SolarPowerYes

The Git Hub Markdown interpreter will automatically recognize a properly typed URL.

***

## Anchor Links w Site Base URL Using the Optional liquid link tag

Internal anchor links may be served locally or remotely using the optional liquid link tag.

Here, the bracketed clickable text `[Target Blank]` is followed by a single set of parenthesis `(...)`.

Inside the single set of parenthesis `(...)` is a double set of braces ie.) a *moustache* statement that references a liquid variable, as follows:

### The Code P

**Note**. The following three ellipsis inside the **Liquid Variable Statement** are shown as merely placeholders.

```liquid
{% raw %}
({{...}})
{% endraw %}
```

In this case ... the site base URL `site.baseurl` followed by another liquid `{\%...\%}` statement that houses the liquid `link` keyword plus a `space` followed by the relative `page` URL of the targeted page `pages/Markdown-Target-Blank.md`.

Using a Triple-backtick highlighted code block with a language qualifier of liquid to illustrate ... all together now!

### The Code Q

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Target Blank]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Markdown-Target-Blank.md %})
{% endraw %}
```

### Live Q

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. [Target Blank]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Markdown-Target-Blank.md %})

***

## Single Backticks

**Rule**. A single set of Back-ticks \`  ` in GitHub Flavored Markdown, or **GFM** will create an inline code block, as follows:

### The Code R

```liquid
{% raw %}
`...`
{% endraw %}
```

### Live R

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. For example, the Visual Studio Code, or **VSC** default colors for a code block may be shown as rendered `<li>`, or line items in an unordered list, as follows:

- `gold colored text`

- `dark grey background`

**Note**. The way to render a `<li>` in a `(.md)` page is to use a hyphen symbol `-` as follows:

### The Code S

```liquid
{% raw %}
- `gold colored text`

- `dark grey background`
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. Remember to append a language qualifier to the first set of Triple-backticks when rendering a highlighted code block in **GFM**.

Also, be sure to leave a blank line after the second set of Triple-backticks, as well.

## Triple Backticks

**Rule**. A double set of triple Back-ticks  in **GFM** will create an multi-line, or "Fenced" highlighted code block, as follows:

### The Code T

```liquid
{% raw %}
The code goes inside the fence ...
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. Always remember to place a language qualifier after the first set of triple Back-ticks when highlighting a multi-line block of code in **GFM**.

Por ejemplo ( for example ), here is a block of `html` that has a double set of triple Back-ticks.

One set of triple Back-ticks is placed above the start of the highlighted code block, and one set of triple Back-ticks is placed below the highlighted code block.

Remember, similar to the **GFM** requirement that a blank line follow a Subtitle, the immediately 'below' set of triple Back-ticks requires a blank line following it, as well.

***

## Subtitles

Subtitles without an "auto" unstyled hard return below may be invoked in a `(.md)` page with a set of double hash `##` placed at the beginning of any line thus yielding the traditional Html `<h2>Title</h2>` header tag.

**Note**. A blank line following a Subtitle is required in **GFM**, or a declared unstyled hard return may be used, as well ( followed by the required blank line! )

## Snippet Insertion In Visual Studio Code

To insert a code snippet in Visual Studio Code, or **VSC** simply select and copy a batch of plain text to the clip board and open up the Command Palette in **VSC**, as follows:

```html
Shortcut to the Command Palette in **VSC**
```

Next, type `Insert Snippet`.

## Support for Emoji in VSC

Support for emoji in Visual Studio Code, or **VSC** when working on a `(.md)` page does not exist at this time ( May '17).

`@rwebaz:+1:`

Solution. Go to GitHub comments to render Emoji

Format ...

:musical_note:

## Italic Text

Text that you wish to be italicized go between ... *single asterisk*

## Bold Text

Text that you wish to look emboldened such as a **Note**. Prefix ... Go between a set of double asterisks `**`...`**`, as follows:

## Double Asterisks

***

## Inline Images

Inline images may be displayed using the exclamation point `!` followed by a bracketed `[Alt Text]` followed by a relative `URL` enclosed in a single set of parenthesis `(...)`, as follows:

### The Code U

```liquid
{% raw %}
![Logo Badge](../assets/ico/ms-icon-70x70.png)
{% endraw %}
```

### Live U

**Por ejemplo en vivo**. ![Logo Badge](../assets/ico/ms-icon-70x70.png)

***

## Referenced Images

Referenced images may be displayed using the exclamation point `!` followed by a bracketed `[Alt Text]` followed by a bracketed index number `[2]`, as follows:

![ePub Badge][2]

The bracketed index number represents a citation below embedded in the `nofooter` of this example.

The citation is the bracketed index number `[2]` followed by a colon `:` followed by the raw `URL` followed by the title to the photo.

Note. The title to the photo is enveloped in a set of double `"..."` quotes.

When the mouse is hovered over the photo the title given will appear.

**Warning**. The Reference-style method for serving links and images will not work on duplicate index numbers attempting to render multiple objects on the same page.

Therefore, always use a separate index number for each set of Reference-style links or images.

As above in the *Reference Style Hyperlink* section, the citation actually sits below this paragraph of text, hidden in the `nofooter` of this example.

[2]:
https://mminail.github.io/images/png/dot-epub-button-62-x-20.png
"The Official Logo Badge of ePub"

## Blockquote

A blockquote may be started with a single right angle bracket `>`, or greater than `&gt;` symbol &gt; :

>This is a blockquote with an Reference-style image below:

![CFFP Logo Banner][3]

As above in the *Reference Style Hyperlink* section, the citation actually sits below this paragraph of text, hidden in the `nofooter` of this example.

[2]:
https://rwebaz.github.io/carbon-free-footprint-project/docs/assets/img/svg/ghp-git-hub-pages-medmjorg-carbon-free-footprint-project-flammarion-got-tree-final-banner-1200-x-230.svg
"The Official CFFP Logo Banner"

## Unstyled Hard Returns

The Unstyled Hard Return counterpart in Html `<hr />` may be reproduced in a `(.md)` page using triple asterisks `***`, as follows:

***

But, not above or below Subtitles.

**Note**. By default, the single hash `#` placed at the beginning of a line in a `(.md)` page yields the traditional Html `<h1>Title</h1>` header tag with an automatically generated unstyled hard return placed below.

## Cross Out Text

How do you cross-out text in a `(.md)` page?

Simple ... Prepend ie.) place at the beginning and Append ie.) place at the end, a double set of enveloping tildes `~~...~~~` that surround the targeted text, as follows:

~~Cross Dis Sh't~~ ... out!

## Listing Image Assets

Listing the various image assets of your repo require a liquid tag statement placed within a `(.htm)` page, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% assign image_files = site.static_files | where: "image", true %}
{% for myimage in image_files %}
  {{ myimage.path }}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. Remember to place a language qualifier `liquid` after the first set of triple backticks when highlighting a multi-line block of code in a `(.md)` page.

***

## Block Text

```liquid
{% raw %}
First Line of Text
>As you can see in the following live rendition, the usage of the "greater than" symbol `>` in this case yields an indented 2nd line of text with a corresponding "thick pipe" drawn preceding Line Number Two.
{% endraw %}
```

## More To Come

As more snippets are generated or found, expect this list to grow.
