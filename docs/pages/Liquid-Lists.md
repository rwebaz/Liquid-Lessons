# Liquid Lists

## Unordered Lists

### The Command Pallette Example

To access the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (VSC), press the following three keys simultaneously:

- shift, or '⇧'

- command, or '⌘'

- capital P, or 'P' ; where capital P represents the term "Palette"

**Note**. The trick to this example is to prepend each list item with a `-` hyphen followed by a space before the start of each list item.

## Ordered Lists

### Check Box Example

- [ ] This is a list item bullet with an open ( space ) check box

To create an ordered list in GFM ( Github Flavored Markdown ) begin each list item with the number `1` followed by a single period `.` followed by a space before the text of each list item, as follows:

1. List Item \#1
1. List Item \#2
1. List Item \#3
