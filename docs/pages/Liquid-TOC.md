# Liquid TOC

{{ page.excerpt }}

{% comment %}Markdown Page Template md Dtd 02-04-18{% endcomment %}

{% include toc.md %}

## Table O Contents

To illustrate ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
- TOC
{:toc}
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. In the above example, when placed below another similar *TOC* code block, the secondary code block is rendered mute, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
Original *TOC* code block ...
- TOC
{:toc}
===========
- TOC
{:toc}
Secondary *TOC* code block ...
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. Though separated by a line of text `===`, the secondary *TOC* code block will not render.
