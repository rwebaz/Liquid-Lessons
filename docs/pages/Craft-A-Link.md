# Craft A Link

How To Craft An External Hyperlink In Markdown With Liquid

{% include toc-flammarion.md %}

## External Hyperlinks

Placing strategic **Liquid** statements enveloped with {% raw %}{{ double sets of curly braces }}{% endraw %} will offer a shortcut to the more common long form way of expressing **Markdown** external hyperlinks.

### Long Cut Links

In **Markdown**, a *long-cut* external hyperlink is crafted with a train of connected statements consisting of first the bracketed clickable text, as follows:

### The Code

```markdown
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project]
{% endraw %}
```

After establishing the bracketed clickable text, next the developer appends the full *long-cut* external Url within a set of single parenthesis `(...)`, as shown below:

```markdown
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project](https://rwebaz.github.io/Liquid-Lessons-Project/)
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. A full *long-cut* external Url in **Markdown** is written the same way as an absolute Url in **Html**.

### Finale Liquid

Finally, a **Liquid** statement may be appended to the tail end of the **Markdown** hyperlink chain in order to designate a target of self or blank.

```markdown
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project](https://rwebaz.github.io/Liquid-Lessons-Project/){:target="_blank"}
{% endraw %}
```

### Live Link

Putting it all together yields the following **Live** rendition ...

- [Liquid Lessons Project](https://rwebaz.github.io/Liquid-Lessons-Project/){:target="_blank"}

## Short Cut Links

**Liquid** *short-cut* external hyperlinks can replace some of the more static elements of a **Markdown** *long-cut* hyperlink with *moustache* statements.

**Note**. A **Liquid** *moustache* is simply another way to say {% raw %}{{ double sets of curly braces }}{% endraw %} with the double sets of curly braces resembling a sort of caricature moustache, don't you see.

### Break It Down Relatively

An analysis of a **Markdown** *long-cut* hyperlink consists of the following primary elements:

1. **Link Title**
- The Title of The Destination
1. **Link Url Full**
- The Full Url
1. **Target Statement**
- The Landing Page ( Self or Blank )

### Dissect Further

The full Url of a hyperlink may be dissected further to reveal the following sub-elements eligible for consideration as static **Liquid** variables:

#### baseurl

1. **Base Url**
- The Directory From Which The Files Are Served
1. **Url**
- The Parental Web Address of Your Designated Project

**Note**. Both the **Base Url** and **Url** may be set in stone as **Liquid** variables via the **Config dot yaml** file.

The `config.yml` file is stored in the docs folder of your repo.

### Base Url Example #1

The **Base Url** represents a static variable named `baseurl` that can be set inside your `config.yml` file representing the subpath of your designated project, e.g. /blog, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
# The 'baseurl' is the subpath of your designated project
baseurl: "/Liquid-Lessons-Project"
{% endraw %}
```

The `baseurl` may then be placed within the *long-cut* hyperlink if locked inside a **Liquid** moustache statement.

An application of this code avoids the repetition of always having to type the same repo subpath when crafting an external hyperlink.

#### Unix Pipe

Let's establish a **Liquid** moustache statement that uses a **Unix** pipe to send the value of your designated path to the built-in site method `relative_url`, also known as a *filter*.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ "/" | relative_url }}
{% endraw %}
```

The built-in site method `relative_url` instructs your development machine to fetch the value of the variable **baseurl** from the **Config dot yaml** file and then prepend the **baseurl** variable to your path entry as shown above in order to create a valid relative link programmatically.

A little backwards, heh?

But, it works!

In effect, we have crafted programmatically the following **long-cut** Url:

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project](../Liquid-Lessons-Project/){:target="_blank"}
{% endraw %}
```

From the following **short-cut** Url statement ...

#### The Code: Short Cut ( Relative ) #1

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project](../{{ "/" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. By setting the path with simply the slash key `"/"` we have invoked the index page of the project.

The path `"/"` shown above is the directory from which your 'index dot md' page will be served, as well as the md files located in the `docs` subdirectory named `pages`.

In this case, we are serving our files via **Git Hub Pages** using the `docs` directory.

The `docs` directory, therefore, becomes the root directory `"/"` for our 'index dot md' file as well as for our 'pages' subdirectory.

Prepending the **baseurl** onto the `"/"` produces, in **long-cut**, the following relative Url statement ...

#### The Code: Long Cut ( Relative ) #1

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project](../Liquid-Lessons-Project/){:target="_blank"}
{% endraw %}
```

Where, the 'Liquid-Lessons-Project' is the variable **baseurl**.

### Base Url Example #2

Here, we are prepending via the **Unix Pipe** the **baseurl** variable from our `config.yml` file onto the pathway shown to create a relative link, as follows:

#### The Code: Long Cut ( Relative ) #2

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project](../Liquid-Lessons-Project/pages/Source-Links){:target="_blank"}
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. It is not required to place a suffix after the title of the targeted page in this relative instance.

**Markdown** will infer the type of page from the code inside and **Kramdown** the file into a standard **Html** file with a ( .html ) suffix.

#### From Afar

However, when crafting an external absolute hyperlink from an external html source page ...

When you do target a file that has been **Kramdown**, be sure to reference the standard ( .html ) suffix.

#### Live Link: Short Cut ( Relative ) #2

Putting it all together yields the following **Live** rendition ...

- [Liquid Lessons Project]({{ "/pages/Source-Links" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}

### Flipping The Switch

If we now substitute the `relative_url` method with the built-in `absolute_url` site method, or *filter*, then the program will instruct your development machine to fetch the value of BOTH the variable **baseurl** ( as in the `relative_url` method shown above ) plus the variable **url**, as well.

Let's try that ...

#### url

Recall from above, the full Url of a hyperlink may be dissected further to reveal the following sub-elements eligible for consideration as static **Liquid** statements:

1. **Base Url**
- The Directory From Which The Files Are Served
1. **Url**
- The Parental Web Address of Your Designated Project

Recall further, that BOTH the **Base Url** and the **Url** may be set in stone as **Liquid** variables via the **Config dot yaml** file stored in the `docs` folder of your repo.

### Absolute Short Cut Links

The **url** is a static variable set inside your `config.yml` file representing the parental web address of your designated project.

This variable can be placed within the code statement of your *short-cut* hyperlink locked inside a **Liquid** moustache statement to avoid the repetition of always having to type the same **url**, or parental web address of your designated project ... all the time, as follows:

#### The Code: Short Cut ( Absolute )

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project]({{ "/index" | absolute_url }}){:target="_blank"}
{% endraw %}
```

#### Live Link: Short Cut ( Absolute )

Putting it all together yields the following **Live** rendition ...

[Liquid Lessons Project]({{ "/index" | absolute_url }}){:target="_blank"}

**Note**. When the "absolute" version of the filter is used, the method instructs your machine to prepend first the value of the **baseurl** variable to your designated path.

And, then secondly ... to prepend the variable of the **url** ... to the **baseurl**.

#### Local Jekyll Server

Locally, when rendering the page over your local Jekyll server, **localhost** is substituted for the **url** and the **baseurl**.

#### Remote Jekyll Server

However, when rendering the page over the remote Jekyll server at the **Git Hub Pages** server farm ...

The **short-cut** link results in the rendering of a **long-cut** link, as follows:

##### The Code: Remote Jekyll Server

```liquid
{% raw %}
[Liquid Lessons Project](https://rwebaz.github.io/Liquid-Lessons-Project/index){:target="_blank"}
{% endraw %}
```

##### Live Link: Remote Jekyll Server

[Liquid Lessons Project](https://rwebaz.github.io/Liquid-Lessons-Project/index){:target="_blank"}

Where, 'rwebaz.github.io' is the parental web address of your designated project, or **url** variable.

And, '/Liquid-Lessons-Project` is the subpath of your designated project, or **baseurl** variable.

Another way to put it is ...

Your designated `path` ( in this case "/index" ) is prepended by the **url** variable ...

That is itself appended by the **baseurl** variable!
