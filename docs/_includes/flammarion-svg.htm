### How To Render SVG In Markup

From the tagline of the **[Inline Images][1]** article at our **[Markdown Lessons Project][2]** ...

**Inline Images** may be displayed in **Markdown** using the exclamation point `!` followed by a bracketed `[Alt Text]` followed by a relative `URL` enclosed in a single set of parenthesis `(...)`.

That includes SVG images, too ... as follows:

#### Base Dimensions

Here, we are using an original `( .xcf )` file that has been exported from **GIMP** as a `( .psd )` of dimensions 725 px X 725 px x 96 dpi.

Next, the resultant `( .psd )` file was imported into **Adobe Illustrator**, or **AI** via simple 'File Open'.

Once inside **AI**, the `( .psd )` file is then "save as" an `( .svg )`.

Out comes a perfectly centered ( to the top horizontal and vertical ) ...

A `( .svg )` file of initial dimensions 543.75 px X 543.75 px, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
![MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge](../assets/img/MMI-Medmj-Org-Got-Tree-Flammarion-Person-Through-Celestial-Sphere-circle-725-x-725.svg)
{% endraw %}
```

#### Responsive SVG

Now, an **SVG** file is both expandable and responsive.

To render a smaller version of the `( .svg )`, simply append an appropriate height and width, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{:height="120px" width="120px"}
{% endraw %}
```

#### Presentation Dimensions

The following **Live** rendition of the **MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge** `( .svg )` image file is set to the dimensions of 500.00 px X 500.00 px, as shown in the following code block:

```liquid
{% raw %}
![MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge](../assets/img/MMI-Medmj-Org-Got-Tree-Flammarion-Person-Through-Celestial-Sphere-circle-725-x-725.svg){:height="500px" width="500px"}
{% endraw %}
```
##### Live Image: SVG In Markup

![MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge](../assets/img/MMI-Medmj-Org-Got-Tree-Flammarion-Person-Through-Celestial-Sphere-circle-725-x-725.svg){:height="500px" width="500px"}

**Note**. When converting a **Kramdown** md file now holding the suffix ( .html ), the ( .mobi ) engine **Dotepub** will return the message [Image in a non-supported format] even though clear as a bell your Chrome browser is rendering the ( .svg ) "No hay problema!"
